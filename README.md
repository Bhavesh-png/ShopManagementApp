## 🗃️ Excel Database (Auto-Managed)

The app uses **ClosedXML** to manage a local `ShopData.xlsx` file.

| Sheet | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `Products` | All inventory items |
| `Sales` | Bill headers |
| `SaleItems` | Individual line items per bill |
| `Repairs` | Repair job records |
| `Settings` | Admin credentials, schema version, **shop info** |

> ✅ **The Excel file is created automatically on first run** — no manual setup needed.  
> ✅ **Schema versioning** — if the file format changes, the app backs up old data and creates a fresh file.  
> ✅ **Shop info is stored per-installation** — different PCs can have different shop names without changing the code.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 🖥️ Option 1 — Install via Setup Wizard (Recommended)

1. Go to [**Releases**](https://github.com/Bhavesh-png/ShopManagementApp/releases/latest)
2. Download `ShopManager_Setup_v1.0.0.exe`
3. Run the installer → follows a standard Windows setup wizard
4. App installs to `Program Files`, creates Desktop & Start Menu shortcuts
5. On first launch, a **Shop Setup** dialog appears — enter your shop name and details
6. Log in with default credentials (`admin` / `1234`) and change the password

> ✅ No .NET installation required — the runtime is bundled inside the installer.

---

### 💻 Option 2 — Run from Source (Developers)

**Prerequisites:**
- Windows 10 / 11
- [.NET 8 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/8.0)
- Visual Studio 2022 or VS Code

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Bhavesh-png/ShopManagementApp.git
cd ShopManagementApp

# Restore NuGet packages
dotnet restore

# Run the application
dotnet run --project ShopManagementApp.UI
```

### 📦 Build Your Own Installer

```bash
# Step 1 — Publish self-contained EXE
dotnet publish ShopManagementApp.UI -c Release -r win-x64 --self-contained true /p:PublishSingleFile=true /p:IncludeNativeLibrariesForSelfExtract=true

# Step 2 — Compile installer (requires Inno Setup)
& "D:\Inno Setup 6\ISCC.exe" "installer\GayatriElectronics_Setup.iss"

# Output: installer\Output\ShopManager_Setup_v1.0.0.exe
```

```

## 🏗️ Key Design Decisions

- **SPA Navigation** — All pages load inside a single `_pageHost` panel. No popup windows, no header overlap.
- **Double Buffering** — `SmoothPanel` class + `WS_EX_COMPOSITED` flag eliminates all flicker during page switching.
- **Schema Versioning** — `ExcelManager` checks a `SchemaVersion` key on startup. Stale schemas trigger auto-backup + fresh file creation.
- **Custom Billing Items** — `ProductId = 0` bypasses stock deduction for non-inventory items (labour charges, misc).
- **Runtime Shop Info** — `Constants.ShopInfo.*` is populated from the Settings sheet at startup. All UI (top bar, sidebar, receipts, admin panel) reads live values — no recompile needed.
- **First-Run Setup** — `FirstRunSetupForm` detects empty `ShopName` in Settings and blocks the main window until the user fills in their shop details.
- **Admin Shop Settings** — Admins can update shop name, address, mobile, and GST at any time from the Admin Panel. Changes take effect immediately without restarting.
- **Portable Build** — Single self-contained EXE bundles the entire .NET runtime.
